# Uncomment and configure for remote state storage (recommended for CI/CD)
# This prevents state conflicts when multiple people/pipelines run terraform

# Option 1: S3 Backend (requires S3 bucket + DynamoDB table)
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
#     key            = "secvault/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-east-1"
#     encrypt        = true
#     dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"  # For state locking
#   }
# }

# Option 2: Terraform Cloud (free for small teams)
# terraform {
#   cloud {
#     organization = "your-org"
#     workspaces {
#       name = "secvault-prod"
#     }
#   }
# }
